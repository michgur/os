ANSWERS:

1. 
    1. `sigsetjmp` stores the current context, including the signal mask, into a buffer. Then, `siglongjmp` can be used with the buffer to restore the context. These functions are useful for handling signals, and restoring the context afterwards.
    2. When `sigsetjmp` gets a non-zero value as its second argument, it saves the current signal mask, which later will be restored by `siglongjmp`. If the second argument is zero, `sigsetjmp` and `siglongjmp` will not affect the signal mask.

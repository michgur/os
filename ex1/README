EX: 1

FILES:
osm.c -- implementation of osm.h
Makefile -- makefile for building the project
results.png -- graph of the results

REMARKS:
On the results graph, the empty function call execution time is similar to the addition operation, both directly on the machine & in the container, I assume it's due to some compiler optimization which removes the function call.

ANSWERS:

Assignment 1:
The program:
- creates 2 nested directories `./welcome_dir_1`, `./welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2/`, both with read, write & execute permissions for all users using mkdir() system calls.
- allocates 0x20000 bytes of memory
- creates a new file `./welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2/welcome_file.txt` with read/write permissions to all users, opens it in write-only mode using an openat() system call.
- opens `/etc/localtime` in read-only mode, reads and closes it using read() system call
- writes the string "welcome to OS-2023" into `welcome_file.txt` and closes the file using write() system call
- removes the file and both directories using unlink(), rmdir() system calls.
- exists successfully
